# Context Composition

Inspired by an old composition notebook I used to track all the notes and references that I came across - this is a minimum viable product demonstrator for the ContextOS paradigm.

The scope is to:
- Set a context to work in
- Created / edited notes are saved with the context attached
- All notes are visible on a single timeline list
- When you enter a context, the notes are filtered to those within the current context
- A chat system allows natural language questioning of the notes in context
- Automatically detect and change context accordingly
